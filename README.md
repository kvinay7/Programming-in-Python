# [Programming in Python](https://github.com/kvinay7/Programming-in-Python/blob/main/Programming%20in%20Python.docx)
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), automation, and scripting.

## ðŸ”¹ **How This is Different from C or Java?**  

| Feature | Python (Interpreted) | Java (Bytecode + JVM) | C (Compiled) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Compilation | Compiled to bytecode automatically at runtime | Compiled to bytecode (`.class` files) | Compiled to machine code (`.exe`, `.out`) |
| Execution | Bytecode runs on Python Virtual Machine (PVM) | Bytecode runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) | Runs directly on CPU |
| Portability | Runs on any OS with Python installed | Runs on any OS with JVM installed | Needs recompilation for different OS |
| Speed | Slower (interpreted at runtime) | Faster than Python | Fastest (direct machine code execution) |
